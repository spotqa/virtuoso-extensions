## Overview

This repository provides a list of extensions that can be used with you [Virtuoso](https://app.virtuoso.qa/) journeys. You can read more about Virtuoso extensions [here](https://docs.virtuoso.qa/guide/making-the-most-of-virtuoso/language-extensions.html#extensions-natural-language-extensions).

The README.md files inside each folder will guide you on how to add these extensions to your Virtuoso project.

## Using expressions

For some of the arithmetic operations, you can also directly use **expressions** to get the desired result. For example, if you want to add two numbers, you may use the extension shared [here](https://github.com/spotqa/virtuoso-extensions/tree/main/Arithmetic#sum) or make use of the expession: `store value ${ 1 + 2 } into $result`.
